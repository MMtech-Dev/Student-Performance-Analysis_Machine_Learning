# Data Visualizations

## Overview
This folder contains visualizations from two complementary student performance analysis projects, demonstrating comprehensive data exploration and pattern recognition skills.

## Student Analytics Project
**Files:** `Assessment_dataset.png`, `Student_assessment.png`, `Studentinfo.png`, `StudentVle_dataset.png`

- **Assessment Analysis**: Distribution of assessment types (TMA, CMA, Exam) and their weighting patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Score distributions, pass/fail rates, and final result breakdowns
- **Student Demographics**: Age bands, gender performance analysis, and socioeconomic indicators (IMD)
- **Learning Behavior**: Submission timelines and assessment scheduling patterns

## Student Performance Classification
**Files:** `Daily_Click_Distribution.png`, `Student_Activity_Timeline.png`, `Top_Active_Students.png`, `Engagement_Distribution.png`

- **Engagement Patterns**: Daily click distributions and activity levels across the course timeline
- **Behavioral Insights**: Student activity peaks, course engagement trends over time
- **Usage Analytics**: Top performing students and overall engagement distribution patterns
- **Learning Materials**: Most accessed content and student interaction patterns

## Technical Details
- **Created with**: Python, Matplotlib, Pandas
- **Data Processing**: Aggregated and anonymized educational datasets
- **Purpose**: Feature exploration for machine learning classification models

These visualizations informed feature engineering and model development for predicting student performance outcomes.
